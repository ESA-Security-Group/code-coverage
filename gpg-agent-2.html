<h2>Description</h2>
<b>gpg-agent</b> is a daemon to manage secret (private) keys independently from any protocol.
It is used as a backend for <b>gpg</b> and <b>gpgsm</b> as well as for a couple of other utilities.
<p>The usual way to run the agent is from the <b>~/.xsession</b> file:
<blockquote><pre class="code">eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)</pre></blockquote>
<p>If you don't use an X server, you can also put this into your regular startup file <b>~/.profile</b> or <b>.bash_profile</b>. It is best not to run multiple
instance of the <b>gpg-agent</b>, so you should make sure that only one is running: <b>gpg-agent</b> uses an environment variable to inform clients about the
communication parameters. You can write the content of this environment variable to a file so that you can test for a running agent. Here is an example using
Bourne shell syntax:
<blockquote><pre class="code">gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support \
          --write-env-file "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info"</pre></blockquote>
<p>This code should only be run once per user session to initially fire up the agent. In the example the optional support for the included Secure Shell agent
is enabled and the information about the agent is written to a file in the HOME directory. Note that by running gpg-agent without arguments you may test
whether an agent is already running; however such a test may lead to a race condition, thus it is not suggested.
<p>The second script needs to be run for each interactive session:
<blockquote><pre class="code">if [ -f "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info" ]; then
  . "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info"
  export GPG_AGENT_INFO
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  export SSH_AGENT_PID
fi</pre></blockquote>
<p>It reads the data out of the file and exports the variables. If you don't use Secure Shell, you don't need the last two export statements.<p>You should always add the following lines to your <b>.bashrc</b> or whatever initialization file is used for all shell invocations:
<blockquote><pre class="code">GPG_TTY=$(tty)
export GPG_TTY</pre></blockquote>
<p>It is important that this environment variable always reflects the output of the <b>tty</b> command. For W32 systems this option is not required.
<p>Please make sure that a proper pinentry program has been installed under the default filename (which is system dependant) or use the option
<b>pinentry-program</b> to specify the full name of that program. It is often useful to install a symbolic link from the actual used pinentry (e.g.
oq<i>/usr/bin/pinentry-gtk</i>cq) to the expected one (e.g. oq<i>/usr/bin/pinentry</i>cq).

<p>Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that only one command is allowed.
<dl compact>
<dt><b>--version</b>
<dd>Print the program version and licensing information. Not that you can abbreviate this command.
<dt><b>--help</b>
<dt><b>-h</b>
<dd>Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line options. Not that you can abbreviate this command.
<dt><b>--dump-options</b>
<dd>Print a list of all available options and commands. Not that you can abbreviate this command.
<dt><b>--server</b>
<dd>Run in server mode and wait for commands on the <b>stdin</b>. The default mode is to create a socket and listen for commands there.
<dt><b>--daemon [<i>command line</i>]</b>
<dd>Start the gpg-agent as a daemon; that is, detach it from the console and run it in the background. Because <b>gpg-agent</b> prints out important
information required for further use, a common way of invoking gpg-agent is: <b>eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)</b> to setup the environment variables. The option
<b>--write-env-file</b> is another way commonly used to do this. Yet another way is creating a new process as a child of gpg-agent: <b>gpg-agent --daemon
/bin/sh</b>. This way you get a new shell with the environment setup properly; if you exit from this shell, gpg-agent terminates as well.</dl>
<h2>Options</h2>
<dl compact>
<dt><b>--options <i>file</i></b>
<dd>Reads configuration from <i>file</i> instead of from the default per-user configuration file. The default configuration file is named
oq<i>gpg-agent.conf</i>cq and expected in the oq<i>.gnupg</i>cq directory directly below the home directory of the user.
<dt><b>--homedir <i>dir</i></b>
<dd>Set the name of the home directory to <i>dir</i>. If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to oq<i>~/.gnupg</i>cq. It is only recognized
when given on the command line. It also overrides any home directory stated through the environment variable oq<i>GNUPGHOME</i>cq or (on W32 systems) by means
of the Registry entry <i>HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</i>.
<dt><b>-v</b>
<dt><b>--verbose</b>
<dd>Outputs additional information while running. You can increase the verbosity by giving several verbose commands to <b>gpgsm</b>, such as aq-vvaq.
<dt><b>-q</b>
<dt><b>--quiet</b>
<dd>Try to be as quiet as possible.
<dt><b>--batch</b>
<dd>Don't invoke a pinentry or do any other thing requiring human interaction.
<dt><b>--faked-system-time <i>epoch</i></b>
<dd>This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system time back or forth to <i>epoch</i> which is the number of seconds elapsed since the year 1970.
<dt><b>--debug-level <i>level</i></b>
<dd>Select the debug level for investigating problems. <i>level</i> may be a numeric value or a keyword:
<dt><b>none</b>
<dd>No debugging at all. A value of less than 1 may be used instead of the keyword.
<dt><b>basic</b>
<dd>Some basic debug messages. A value between 1 and 2 may be used instead of the keyword.
<dt><b>advanced</b>
<dd>More verbose debug messages. A value between 3 and 5 may be used instead of the keyword.
<dt><b>expert</b>
<dd>Even more detailed messages. A value between 6 and 8 may be used instead of the keyword.
<dt><b>guru</b>
<dd>All of the debug messages you can get. A value greater than 8 may be used instead of the keyword. The creation of hash tracing files is only enabled if the
keyword is used.</dl>
<p>How these messages are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not specified and may change with newer releases of this program. They are however carefully
selected to best aid in debugging.
<dl compact>
<dt><b>--debug <i>flags</i></b>
<dd>This option is only useful for debugging and the behaviour may change at any time without notice. FLAGS are bit encoded and may be given in usual C-Syntax.
The currently defined bits are:
<dt><b>0 (1)</b>
<dd>X.509 or OpenPGP protocol related data
<dt><b>1 (2)</b>
<dd>values of big number integers
<dt><b>2 (4)</b>
<dd>low level crypto operations
<dt><b>5 (32)</b>
<dd>memory allocation
<dt><b>6 (64)</b>
<dd>caching
<dt><b>7 (128)</b>
<dd>show memory statistics.
<dt><b>9 (512)</b>
<dd>write hashed data to files named <b>dbgmd-000*</b>
<dt><b>10 (1024)</b>
<dd>trace Assuan protocol
<dt><b>12 (4096)</b></dl>bypass all certificate validation
<dl compact>
<dt><b>--debug-all</b>
<dd>
<p>Same as <b>--debug=0xffffffff</b>
<dt><b>--debug-wait <i>n</i></b>
<dd>When running in server mode, wait <i>n</i> seconds before entering the actual processing loop and print the pid. This gives time to attach a debugger.
<dt><b>--no-detach</b>
<dd>Don't detach the process from the console. This is mainly useful for debugging.
<dt><b>-s</b>
<dt><b>--sh</b>
<dt><b>-c</b>
<dt><b>--csh</b>
<dd>Format the info output in daemon mode for use with the standard Bourne shell or the C-shell respectively. The default is to guess it based on the
environment variable <b>SHELL</b> which is correct in almost all cases.
<dt><b>--write-env-file <i>file</i></b>
<dd>Often it is required to connect to the agent from a process not being an inferior of <b>gpg-agent</b> and thus the environment variable with the socket
name is not available. To help setting up those variables in other sessions, this option may be used to write the information into <i>file</i>. If <i>file</i>
is not specified the default name oq<i>${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info</i>cq will be used. The format is suitable to be evaluated by a Bourne shell like in this simple
example:
<blockquote><pre class="code">eval $(cat file)
eval $(cut -d= -f 1 &lt; file | xargs echo export)</pre></blockquote>
<dt><b>--no-grab</b>
<dd>Tell the pinentry not to grab the keyboard and mouse. This option should in general not be used to avoid X-sniffing attacks.
<dt><b>--log-file <i>file</i></b>
<dd>Append all logging output to <i>file</i>. This is very helpful in seeing what the agent actually does.
<dt><b>--allow-mark-trusted</b>
<dd>Allow clients to mark keys as trusted, i.e. put them into the oq<i>trustlist.txt</i>cq file. This is by default not allowed to make it harder for users to
inadvertently accept Root-CA keys.
<dt><b>--ignore-cache-for-signing</b>
<dd>This option will let <b>gpg-agent</b> bypass the passphrase cache for all signing operation. Note that there is also a per-session option to control this
behaviour but this command line option takes precedence.
<dt><b>--default-cache-ttl <i>n</i></b>
<dd>Set the time a cache entry is valid to <i>n</i> seconds. The default is 600 seconds.
<dt><b>--default-cache-ttl-ssh <i>n</i></b>
<dd>Set the time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid to <i>n</i> seconds. The default is 1800 seconds.
<dt><b>--max-cache-ttl <i>n</i></b>
<dd>Set the maximum time a cache entry is valid to <i>n</i> seconds. After this time a cache entry will be expired even if it has been accessed recently. The
default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).
<dt><b>--max-cache-ttl-ssh <i>n</i></b>
<dd>Set the maximum time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid to <i>n</i> seconds. After this time a cache entry will be expired even if it has been
accessed recently. The default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).
<dt><b>--enforce-passphrase-constraints</b>
<dd>Enforce the passphrase constraints by not allowing the user to bypass them using the ''Take it anyway'' button.
<dt><b>--min-passphrase-len <i>n</i></b>
<dd>Set the minimal length of a passphrase. When entering a new passphrase shorter than this value a warning will be displayed. Defaults to 8.
<dt><b>--min-passphrase-nonalpha <i>n</i></b>
<dd>Set the minimal number of digits or special characters required in a passphrase. When entering a new passphrase with less than this number of digits or
special characters a warning will be displayed. Defaults to 1.
<dt><b>--check-passphrase-pattern <i>file</i></b>
<dd>Check the passphrase against the pattern given in <i>file</i>. When entering a new passphrase matching one of these pattern a warning will be displayed.
<i>file</i> should be an absolute filename. The default is not to use any pattern file.
<p>Security note: It is known that checking a passphrase against a list of pattern or even against a complete dictionary is not very effective to enforce good
passphrases. Users will soon figure up ways to bypass such a policy. A better policy is to educate users on good security behavior and optionally to run a
passphrase cracker regularly on all users passphrases to catch the very simple ones.
<dt><b>--max-passphrase-days <i>n</i></b>
<dd>Ask the user to change the passphrase if <i>n</i> days have passed since the last change. With <b>--enforce-passphrase-constraints</b> set the user may not
bypass this check.
<dt><b>--enable-passphrase-history</b>
<dd>This option does nothing yet.
<dt><b>--pinentry-program <i>filename</i></b>
<dd>Use program <i>filename</i> as the PIN entry. The default is installation dependent and can be shown with the <b>--version</b> command.
<dt><b>--pinentry-touch-file <i>filename</i></b>
<dd>By default the filename of the socket gpg-agent is listening for requests is passed to Pinentry, so that it can touch that file before exiting (it does
this only in curses mode). This option changes the file passed to Pinentry to <i>filename</i>. The special name <b>/dev/null</b> may be used to completely
disable this feature. Note that Pinentry will not create that file, it will only change the modification and access time.
<dt><b>--scdaemon-program <i>filename</i></b>
<dd>Use program <i>filename</i> as the Smartcard daemon. The default is installation dependent and can be shown with the <b>--version</b> command.
<dt><b>--disable-scdaemon</b>
<dd>Do not make use of the scdaemon tool. This option has the effect of disabling the ability to do smartcard operations. Note, that enabling this option at
runtime does not kill an already forked scdaemon.
<dt><b>--use-standard-socket</b>
<dt><b>--no-use-standard-socket</b>
<dd>By enabling this option <b>gpg-agent</b> will listen on the socket named oq<i>S.gpg-agent</i>cq, located in the home directory, and not create a random
socket below a temporary directory. Tools connecting to <b>gpg-agent</b> should first try to connect to the socket given in environment variable
<i>GPG_AGENT_INFO</i> and then fall back to this socket. This option may not be used if the home directory is mounted as a remote file system. Note, that
<b>--use-standard-socket</b> is the default on Windows systems.
<dt><b>--display <i>string</i></b>
<dt><b>--ttyname <i>string</i></b>
<dt><b>--ttytype <i>string</i></b>
<dt><b>--lc-ctype <i>string</i></b>
<dt><b>--lc-messages <i>string</i></b>
<dt><b>--xauthority <i>string</i></b>
<dd>These options are used with the server mode to pass localization information.
<dt><b>--keep-tty</b>
<dt><b>--keep-display</b>
<dd>Ignore requests to change the current <b>tty</b> or X window system's <b>DISPLAY</b> variable respectively. This is useful to lock the pinentry to pop up
at the <b>tty</b> or display you started the agent.
<dt><b>--enable-ssh-support</b>
<dd>
<p>Enable emulation of the OpenSSH Agent protocol.
<p>In this mode of operation, the agent does not only implement the gpg-agent protocol, but also the agent protocol used by OpenSSH (through a separate
socket). Consequently, it should be possible to use the gpg-agent as a drop-in replacement for the well known ssh-agent.
<p>SSH Keys, which are to be used through the agent, need to be added to the gpg-agent initially through the ssh-add utility. When a key is added, ssh-add will
ask for the password of the provided key file and send the unprotected key material to the agent; this causes the gpg-agent to ask for a passphrase, which is
to be used for encrypting the newly received key and storing it in a gpg-agent specific directory.
<p>Once a key has been added to the gpg-agent this way, the gpg-agent will be ready to use the key.
<p>Note: in case the gpg-agent receives a signature request, the user might need to be prompted for a passphrase, which is necessary for decrypting the stored
key. Since the ssh-agent protocol does not contain a mechanism for telling the agent on which display/terminal it is running, gpg-agent's ssh-support will use
the TTY or X display where gpg-agent has been started. To switch this display to the current one, the following command may be used:
<blockquote><pre class="code">echo UPDATESTARTUPTTY | gpg-connect-agent</pre></blockquote></dl>
<p>All the long options may also be given in the configuration file after stripping off the two leading dashes.
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The usual way to invoke
<p><b>gpg-agent</b> is
<blockquote><pre class="code">$ eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)</pre></blockquote>
<p>An alternative way is by replacing <b>ssh-agent</b> with <b>gpg-agent</b>. If for example <b>ssh-agent</b> is started as part of the Xsession
initialization, you may simply replace <b>ssh-agent</b> by a script like:
<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/gpg-agent --enable-ssh-support --daemon \
      --write-env-file ${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info "$@"</pre></blockquote>
<p>and add something like (for Bourne shells)
<blockquote><pre class="code">if [ -f "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info" ]; then
  . "${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info"
  export GPG_AGENT_INFO
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  export SSH_AGENT_PID
fi</pre></blockquote>
<p>to your shell initialization file (e.g. oq<i>~/.bashrc</i>cq).
<h2>Files</h2>
<p>There are a few configuration files needed for the operation of the agent. By default they may all be found in the current home directory (see: [option
--homedir]).
<dl compact>
<dt><b>gpg-agent.conf</b>
<dd>This is the standard configuration file read by <b>gpg-agent</b> on<br>
startup. It may contain any valid long option; the leading<br>
two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.<br>
This file is also read after a <b>SIGHUP</b> however only a few<br>
options will actually have an effect. This default name may be<br>
changed on the command line (see: [option --options]).<br>
You should backup this file.<br>
<dt><b>trustlist.txt</b>
<dd>This is the list of trusted keys. You should backup this file.<p>Comment lines, indicated by a leading hash mark, as well as empty<br>
lines are ignored. To mark a key as trusted you need to enter its<br>
fingerprint followed by a space and a capital letter <b>S</b>. Colons<br>
may optionally be used to separate the bytes of a fingerprint; this<br>
allows to cut and paste the fingerprint from a key listing output. If<br>
the line is prefixed with a <b>!</b> the key is explicitly marked as<br>
not trusted.<p>
Here is an example where two keys are marked as ultimately trusted<br>
and one as not trusted:<p>
.RS 2<pre class="code">  # CN=Wurzel ZS 3,O=Intevation GmbH,C=DE
  A6935DD34EF3087973C706FC311AA2CCF733765B S

  # CN=PCA-1-Verwaltung-02/O=PKI-1-Verwaltung/C=DE
  DC:BD:69:25:48:BD:BB:7E:31:6E:BB:80:D3:00:80:35:D4:F8:A6:CD S
  # CN=Root-CA/O=Schlapphuete/L=Pullach/C=DE
  !14:56:98:D3:FE:9C:CA:5A:31:6E:BC:81:D3:11:4E:00:90:A3:44:C2 S
  .fi

Before entering a key into this file, you need to ensure its
authenticity.  How to do this depends on your organisation; your
administrator might have already entered those keys which are deemed
trustworthy enough into this file.  Places where to look for the
fingerprint of a root certificate are letters received from the CA or
the website of the CA (after making 100% sure that this is indeed the
website of that CA).  You may want to consider allowing interactive
updates of this file by using the see: [option --allow-mark-trusted].
This is however not as secure as maintaining this file manually.  It is
even advisable to change the permissions to read-only so that this file
can't be changed inadvertently.
As a special feature a line include-default will include a global
list of trusted certificates (e.g. oq/etc/gnupg/trustlist.txtcq).
This global list is also used if the local list is not available.
It is possible to add further flags after the S for use by the
caller:

relaxRelax checking of some root certificate requirements.  This is forexample
required if the certificate is missing the basicConstraintsattribute (despite
that it is a MUST for CA certificates).cmIf validation of a certificate
finally issued by a CA with this flag setfails, try again using the chain
validation model.  sshcontrolThis file is used when support for the secure
shell agent protocol hasbeen enabled (see: [option --enable-ssh-support]). Only
keys present inthis file are used in the SSH protocol.  You should backup
this file.The ssh-add tool may be used to add new entries to this file;you
may also add them manually.  Comment lines, indicated by a leadinghash mark,
as well as empty lines are ignored.  An entry starts withoptional whitespace,
followed by the keygrip of the key given as 40 hexdigits, optionally followed
by the caching TTL in seconds and anotheroptional field for arbitrary flags.
 A non-zero TTL overrides the globaldefault as set by --default-cache-ttl-ssh.The
keygrip may be prefixed with a ! to disable an entry entry.    The following
example lists exactly one key.  Note that keys availablethrough a OpenPGP
smartcard in the active smartcard reader areimplicitly added to this list;
i.e. there is no need to list them.    .RS 2  # Key added on 2005-02-25 15:08:29
 5A6592BF45DC73BD876874A28FD4639282E29B52 0  .fiprivate-keys-v1.d/  This is
the directory where gpg-agent stores the private keys.  Each  key is stored
in a file with the name made up of the keygrip and the  suffix oqkeycq.
 You should backup all files in this directory  and take great care to
keep this backup closed away.Note that on larger installations, it is useful
to put predefinedfiles into the directory oq/etc/skel/.gnupg/cq so that
newly createdusers start up with a working configuration.  For existing
users thea small helper script is provided to create these files (see:
[addgnupghome]).SignalsA running gpg-agent may be controlled by signals,
i.e. using the kill command to send a signal to the process.   Here is a list
of supported signals:   SIGHUP This signal flushes all cached passphrases
and if the program has been started with a configuration file, the configuration
file is read again. Only certain options are honored: quiet, verbose, debug,
debug-all, debug-level, no-grab, pinentry-program, default-cache-ttl, max-cache-ttl,
ignore-cache-for-signing, allow-mark-trusted and disable-scdaemon.  scdaemon-program
is also supported but due to the current implementation, which calls the
scdaemon only once, it is not of much use unless you manually kill the
scdaemon.   SIGTERM Shuts down the process but waits until all current requests
are fulfilled.  If the process has received 3 of these signals and requests
are still pending, a shutdown is forced.  SIGINT Shuts down the process
immediately.  SIGUSR1 Dump internal information to the log file.  SIGUSR2
This signal is used for internal purposes.    See <b>Alsogpg2</b>(1),  <b><a href="gpgsm">gpgsm</a></b>(1),
 <b><a href="gpg-connect-agent">gpg-connect-agent</a></b>(1), <b><a href="scdaemon">scdaemon</a></b>(1)  The full documentation for this tool
is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the info program are properly
installed at your site, the command
info gnupg</pre>should give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure and an index.
